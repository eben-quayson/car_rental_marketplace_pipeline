# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies and best practices for the EMR Spark processing system. It ensures that data, infrastructure, and scripts are protected from unauthorized access and breaches.

## Access Control
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: 
  - The EMR cluster is assigned an IAM role with **least privilege** access to S3, Glue, and other AWS services.
  - Ensure only authorized users can start, stop, or modify EMR clusters.
- **S3 Bucket Permissions**: 
  - Scripts and logs stored in S3 should have restricted access.
  - Use **bucket policies** and **KMS encryption** to secure data.
- **EC2 Security Groups**:
  - The EMR cluster should be accessible only from trusted sources.
  - SSH access should be disabled or restricted to specific IP addresses.

## Data Protection
- **Encryption**:
  - **At rest**: Use AWS **S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE-KMS)** for logs and job scripts.
  - **In transit**: Enable **SSL/TLS** when communicating with S3, RDS, or other services.
- **Logging & Monitoring**:
  - Enable **CloudTrail** to track changes in IAM, EMR, and S3.
  - Enable **CloudWatch logs** to monitor job execution.
- **Key Management**:
  - Use **AWS KMS** for managing access keys securely.

## Incident Response
- **Alerts & Notifications**:
  - Use AWS CloudWatch **alarms** and **SNS notifications** for job failures.
- **Audit & Review**:
  - Regularly review IAM roles, security groups, and logs.
  - Rotate access credentials and API keys periodically.
